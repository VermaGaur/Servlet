This project demonstrates the creation and execution of a Servlet-based dynamic web application using manual configurations and Apache Tomcat 10. The focus is on understanding the core structure and workflow of Servlets, aligned with interview preparation.

Key Steps and Features:

1) Servlet Basics with Interview Perspective

-> Studied the main Servlet class and its types, focusing on implementations with fewer abstract methods.
-> Gained a practical understanding of Servlets by manually coding without the use of advanced IDEs.

2)Manual Setup and Dynamic Page Creation

-> Downloaded and configured Apache Tomcat 10 as the application server.
-> Created a dynamic web page using Servlets and manually wrote all necessary files in Notepad.
-> Set up the project in the C drive, adhering to the standard Servlet directory structure.

3) XML Configuration

-> Manually created a deployment descriptor (web.xml) to map the Servlet and configure the application.

4)Deployment and Execution

-> Opened the Tomcat Manager App and deployed the project using the web.xml file.
-> Verified the deployment under the project name Pehlaproject.
-> Accessed the application via http://localhost:8082/test, where the dynamic web page was visible.

* Prerequisites:
-> Apache Tomcat 10: Download and install the server.
-> Basic knowledge of Servlets and their directory structure.
-> Use of Command Prompt and Notepad for manual setup.

* Instructions to Run:
-> Start the Apache Tomcat server by running tomcat10.exe.
-> Open your browser and go to http://localhost:8082.
-> Navigate to the Tomcat Manager App and deploy the web.xml file.
-> Access your project by visiting http://localhost:8082/test.
  
This project provides hands-on experience in building and deploying a Servlet-based application without relying on IDE automation, emphasizing an in-depth understanding of the underlying processes.
